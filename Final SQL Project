#I've created some questions and provided answers for my final SQL project.

#1. What's the average price on the track "Crazy"?
SELECT AVG(unitprice), trackid, name
FROM chinook.tracks
GROUP BY name
HAVING TrackId='34';

#2. Which customers purchased the "Jagged Little Pill" album including the track "You Oughta Know"?
SELECT DISTINCT cust.customerid
FROM chinook.customers cust
INNER JOIN chinook.invoices inv ON cust.customerid = inv.customerid
INNER JOIN chinook.invoice_items items ON inv.invoiceid = items.invoiceid
INNER JOIN chinook.tracks song ON items.trackid = song.trackid
WHERE song.trackid = '39';

#3. Create an "American" flag column assigning a customer with a 3 when they reside in the USA.
SELECT FirstName, LastName, Country,
CASE WHEN Country='USA' THEN "3"
ELSE 0 END "American"
FROM chinook.customers;
